# PulsepointScraper
Get notifications about certain medical emergencies at custom locations (highly configurable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/TrevorBagels/PulsepointScraper.git`
2. Navigate to the new directory `cd PulsepointScraper`
3. Install requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Make sure to configure before using!

## Configuration
Open config.json to start doing some configuration. You'll need to fill out the API keys for google maps and pushover, or things might not work properly. Everything else should work, but configuring the program is highly recommended if you intend to actually use it.

## Usage
Simply run `python3 main.py` and everything should work. Note: **this has only been tested on mac, linux/windows versions will be available soon.**
